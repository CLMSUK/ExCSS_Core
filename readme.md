# ExCSS With Some Pull Requests include to make it useable *

[ExCSS](https://github.com/TylerBrinks/ExCSS) is great (as v2 was), but needs some changes from the current master to make it useable (just a couple of bit's made public and moved to .NET Standard 2.0).

I've made the changes here as the pull requests don't seem to be getting incorporated at the moment.

If the changes are made to the main repro (I've asked to be a contributor), this will be deleted.
